  <h2>Stay organized with easy distribution and automatic tracking.</h2> 
  <p>E-mailing a Resume from your standard e-mail browser can be problematic, sometimes resulting in an unreadable or unprofessional submission â€“ even though it looked fine on your end!</p> 
  <p>When you e-mail your Resume directly from our web site, they will arrive safely and look as good as they do on-screen. And you'll never have to guess if your resume reached its destination; you'll get a confirmation when it's sent, and the online Tracker will give a "failed" notice if the submission should get bounced back to our server.</p>
