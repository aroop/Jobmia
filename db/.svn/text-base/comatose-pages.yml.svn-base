        The most common cause of this is that your browser isn't set to accept cookies (a cookie is a text-only string that gets entered into the memory of your browser). Jobmia requires that cookies are turned on so the application can track your session and know who you are as you use Jobmia.
        
        Instructions for turning on cookies in most web browsers can be found at <a href="http://www.associatedkyotoprogram.org/alumni/cookies.shtml">Turning on Cookies</a>. For more information on cookies, see this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie">Wikipedia entry</a>.
        
        The other possibility is you have a firewall or security system set up that is too strict. It's preventing cookies from being accepted or Javascript from being run. Jobmia needs both cookies and javascript in order to function properly.
